# Node.js Backend Deployment on AWS EC2  
(Docker, Nginx, HTTPS, CI/CD, PM2)

This project demonstrates a **production-style deployment** of a Node.js backend application on AWS EC2.  
It focuses on how backend services are **containerized, secured, and automatically deployed** using modern DevOps practices.

The goal of this project is not just to “make it work”, but to understand **how real-world backend systems are deployed and maintained**.

##  Traffic Flow

```

   │
   ▼
HTTPS (443)
   │
   ▼
Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
   │
   ▼
HTTP (Internal)
   │
   ▼
Docker Container

##  Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js (Express)
- **Compute:** AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Process Management:** PM2 (`pm2-runtime`)
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx
- **Security:** HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt (Certbot)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **DNS:** Custom domain with A record

---

##  Key Features

- Dockerized Node.js backend
- Nginx reverse proxy (no direct public access to app port)
- HTTPS with automatic certificate renewal
- CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments
- PM2 for application resilience and restarts
- Clean Git practices using `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`
- Separation of human SSH access and CI/CD access

---

##  CI/CD Workflow (GitHub Actions)

On every push to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub Actions pipeline is triggered
2. Workflow securely connects to EC2 via SSH
3. Latest code is pulled from GitHub
4. Docker image is rebuilt
5. Existing container is replaced
6. Updated version is deployed automatically

This removes the need for manual SSH-based deployments.

---

##  Security Considerations

- Application runs behind Nginx (ports **80 / 443 only**)
- Backend application port (**3000**) is private
- HTTPS enforced with HTTP → HTTPS redirect
- Separate SSH keys for:
  - Human access
  - CI/CD automation
- Secrets stored securely in GitHub Actions Secrets

### Key Learnings

1.Difference between local development and production deployment

2.Why reverse proxies are used in front of backend services

3.How HTTPS terminates at Nginx instead of the application

4.Importance of separating human access from CI/CD automation

5.Debugging container restart loops using logs

6.How CI/CD pipelines reduce deployment risk and manual work


### Notes

This project was built to simulate a real-world backend deployment scenario rather than a local or demo setup.
All deployments are automated using CI/CD to reduce manual intervention and configuration drift.
Security best practices such as HTTPS, reverse proxying, and restricted access to application ports were applied.
